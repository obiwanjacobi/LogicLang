Laws:
(* and, + or, ! not)

- Annulment:
When one input is a fixed value and constraints the output to a fixed value.
A + 1 = 1
A * 0 = 0

- Identity:
When one input is a fixed value and the resulting output reflects the value of the other input.
A + 0 = A
A * 1 = A

- Idempotent
When both inputs receive their value from the same origin and that origin is reflected in the output.
A + A = A
A * A = A

- Complement
When one input receives the inverse of the other input.
A + !A = 1
A * !A = 0

- Double Negation
When an input is inverted an even amount of time, the original value is at its output.
!(!A) = A

-Associative
And an Or are associative. Multiple inputs in any order always result in the same output.
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
A * (B * C) = (A * B) * C

- Communatative
And and Or are communatative. Inputs can be swapped without changes to the output.
A + B = B + A
A * B = B * A

- Distributive
Or:  A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C)
And: A + (B * C) = (A + B) * (A + C)
Factorization is the opposite.

- Absorptive
A + (A * B) = A
A * (A + B) = A

- DeMorgan's theorum
Inverting the inputs and the operation creates the same result
"The complement of the product of 2 vars equals the sum of their complements"
!(A * B) = !A + !B
"The complement of the sum of 2 vars equals the product of their complements"
!(A + B) = !A * !B
